# README: Text Processing Notebooks

## Overview
This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks for various text processing tasks, focusing on cleaning punctuation and detecting specific words in text data. The notebooks are structured to provide step-by-step guidance for preprocessing and analysis.

## Notebooks

### 1. **`clean_punc.ipynb`**
   - **Purpose**: Removes unwanted punctuation from text data to prepare it for further analysis or model training.
   - **Features**:
     - Handles text cleaning with customizable options.
     - Includes examples for cleaning raw datasets.
     - Outputs clean, ready-to-use text for downstream tasks.
   - **How to Use**:
     - Load your dataset into the provided cells.
     - Specify the punctuation marks to remove.
     - Execute the cells to get the cleaned text.

### 2. **`detect_word.ipynb`**
   - **Purpose**: Detects specific words or patterns in text data.
   - **Features**:
     - Searches for predefined words or phrases in text.
     - Returns matches with indices or highlights in text.
     - Provides examples of word detection in a dataset.
   - **How to Use**:
     - Load the text data in the specified format.
     - Define the words or patterns to detect.
     - Run the cells to see results.

### 3. **`detect_word_updated.ipynb`**
   - **Purpose**: An enhanced version of `detect_word.ipynb` with additional features.
   - **Features**:
     - Optimized for large datasets.
     - Includes visualization for word occurrences.
     - Supports advanced pattern matching using regular expressions.
   - **How to Use**:
     - Follow the instructions in the notebook to load and process text data.
     - Utilize the advanced options for customization.

## Prerequisites
- **Python**: 3.7 or higher  
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Installed via Anaconda or pip  
- **Required Libraries**:
  - pandas
  - NumPy
  - re (for regular expressions)

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <project_folder>
   ```
2. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
3. Open the desired notebook (`clean_punc.ipynb`, `detect_word.ipynb`, or `detect_word_updated.ipynb`) and execute the cells sequentially.

---

## Customization
- Modify the input data source to load your dataset.
- Update the list of punctuation marks or words to clean/detect based on your requirements.
- Experiment with the visualization features in `detect_word_updated.ipynb`.

---

## Future Enhancements
- Add a notebook for multilingual text processing.
- Include sentiment analysis based on detected words.
- Expand functionality for integration with machine learning pipelines.
